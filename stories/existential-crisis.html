    <h1>The Crisis I could not have avoided</h1>
    <div>
        Another day in this dorm. Just barely opening my eyes so I wouldn’t suddenly show that I woke up to my
        roommate who will perceive it as an invitation to talk and I won’t be able to squeeze an another 30 minutes of sleep.
        Now after an hour and a half I decided to get out of the bed, right foot first, I make no mistakes. Brush my teeth, the
        toilet stinks again, god knows what the neighbors next door ate(again). Wash my face, acne is not a good sign. Pull out
        my bowl big enough for soup but slightly way too big for tea, shit, forgot to wash it after chicken wings I ate
        yesterday, well, I mean it was yesterday, and the sauces are dried out on the walls of the cup, might as well save time
        and fill up my bowl with oats, plane oats. Pour down some boiling water, close the lid, should I be using the plastic
        lid to cover something so hot? yes. Now I watch my favorite episode of anything that I already watched, trust me, it is
        not a disorder. Now that I am done with pushing down the oats down my throat with just enough timing not to puke before
        I swallow - my day begins. Pull ups, yes, I have one in my poor mans homeless shelter. Abs, stretching. Finally some
        yoga. Why do I do all of this? am I subconsciously doing this because I know I am fat and secretly lying to myself by
        sucking in my stomach every time I walk around without a shirt or something skin tight? Or is it because I know that I
        don’t have what it takes to study in a technical university and I pour so much time into working out because it is the
        only thing in my life which doesn’t take much brain power and even my adhd mixed in with my bipolar disorder doesn’t
        stop me from finishing? Done, man that was a nice workout. Now I need to go to the shower, well, I get the towel and
        shampoo. I sit. Why do I need to prepare myself mentally every time I need to go to the shower? Is it because I am
        scared that the pores on my face are covered with sweat and oil from the workout and even the shampoo won’t wash it off,
        and that feeling of having a dirty face will make me think that I will get acne and clog my pores even more? I’m in the
        shower, wash really fast. I feel the water raise up to my ankle, suka ebanaya, the neighbor girl didn’t thrown away her
        hair so the drain got clogged. I get out. Wipe myself fast, important. Why do I wipe myself so fast? Is it because I’m
        scared that if I take too long then the skin on my head will start to peel off and I will have a lot of dandruff? Man I
        feel refreshed. Finally cooking dinner. I hope my roommate didn’t cook something that would stick to the bottom of the
        pan. Huesos, I hate him. Washed the pan for 30 minutes. I’m so happy I can finally cook. I love fried chicken with rice.
        Or do I love it because it’s not only easy to cook but subconsciously I just lie to myself that eating this meal
        everyday in longterm will make you lose weight and I won’t be worried that the only thing I’m good at which is working
        out doesn’t help me and this will be an another plate on the already weak shoulders that’s keeping me away from an
        another breakdown? Mmm delicious, as always the rice tastes great. What will I watch, Oh, half of the portion is gone.
        Finally I found it. An episode of a tv show I already saw seven times, no it’s not a disorder. Maybe tea? or cold water?
        deciding for 20 minutes. Drank the leftover black tea from two days ago, no it’s not gross or sad, I love saving up,
        lie. Time for bed, Finally I can read a book like I do everyday, I tell myself everyday. Jump onto instagram, vk,
        instagram, vk, reddit, feel pathetic and sad, instagram, dream about a future where I have a beautiful loving wife for
        20 minutes, and I’m gone.
