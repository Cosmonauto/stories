    <h1>3 in 1</h1>
    <div>Today we bought a 3 in 1 pull-up bar because of the quarantine. We tricked the dorm engineer to screw in the hooks that
    will hold the bar. First we told him that we just wanted a bookshelf, but when he said that he needs the bookshelf to
    adjust the height, our stupid asses brought out the pull-up bar. His first reaction was to leave and tell the head of
    the dorm that we wanted something dangerous on the wall(let me explain why it’s dangerous, first of all, we hang onto
    it, and it becomes heavy, and the dorm was built in 1953, I’m not going to say anything else). Luckily we were fast
    enough to stop him and tell him that the pull-up bar can be hung up and taken down at any given time(Which makes no
    fucking sense cause we will still be pulling up and doing stupid shit on it), this one excuse for an argument was enough
    to convince the engineer(pizdec blya that was easy). He immediately started to drill the holes to insert the hooks. When
    he was on drilling the hole for the third hook we understood that we went through the wall and out so now we had a see
    through hole to our neighbors room(not like it was the first one). So after some scrutiny the engineer finished his job
    and left us with four hooks for our pull up bar, and we were left with two eye-holes to our neighbors room.
