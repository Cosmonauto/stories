    <h1>Neighbors</h1>
    <div>Nothing is really known about our neighbors. We can hear them sometimes, we hear their laughs, their door shutting,
    locking. One day the dorm principle came to our room to do a checkup, I was alone at the moment while my roommate went
    outside to get groceries. As the dorm principle was leaving I asked her if she knows anything about the neighbors who
    live next door to us.</br>
    -Ti ebanulsya? She politely whispered into my ear. That room was empty for four years, dyadya.
    With that, she left like the autumn leaves, carried by the strong winds on a cold Novemberâ€™s afternoon.
