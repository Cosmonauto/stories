    <h1>Ticket home</h1>
    <div>
I woke up to an alarm, hung over from yesterday and barely squeezing in three hours of sleep, I went to the laundry room, left my dirty clothes and proceeded dressing up and making my shake so that I could have breakfast on the go. I left the apartment just before the sun was about to burn the exposed part of my neck, came to the “aviakassa”. The place was already packed with people, expected, when you came in four minutes after the place opened(idiot). A fat man punches a woman in a hijab, for her political views on the right way to drop the shower curtain on the kitchen table. Now I proceed to ask everyone who is the last person in line, just so that I could hear that I’m a loved child and that my birth wasn’t a mistake. I find my place in the line and in life. Suddenly I feel a hand moving down my spine, proceeding down to my buttocks, only to see a small child and his fathers hand tickling the  levis logo on my jeans. I feel a sudden urge for blood, or maybe it’s the slain souls from the sword of Arthur that my dad passed down to me as a family heir loom. Finally I’m the first in line for the tickets and my uncles inheritance. As I slowly pull out the cash to buy the tickets I notice a glance from across the room. To my surprise it’s my will to live an another day. I pay the cashier and in return she throws the plane ticket on the ground while gently spitting on it, I politely ask her -“ti ebanulas’ dura?”, to which she embraces me like my mother used to when I was three years old. The lesson learned here today - there isn’t a right way to drop the shower curtain onto the kitchen table.
